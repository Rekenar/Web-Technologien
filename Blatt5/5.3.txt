Exercise 3 – Working with Promises

This exercise only works when using a web server. Therefore, place the provided folder ex3
in the document root of your web server. The folder contains the files galleryA.htm,
galleryA.js, galleryB.htm, galleryB.js and gallery.json. In the
subfolder details, there is one json file containing the description of each image.


a) Write a method loadImages(domElement, jsonURL) in galleryA.js
that requests the file jsonURL via the JS fetch API.
The json file contains a descURL property for each image. The descURL refers to
another json file that contains one single image description.
Like in Assignment 2, create a div for each image containing the image element and
the description. However, now the description needs to be loaded with an additional
fetch request from the description json file of each picture.
In case some description file cannot be opened the description field should have the
value “error, description could not be loaded”.
The order of images shown on the page galleryA.html must be the same as in
the gallery.json file.
For part A implement the requests using “then” and “catch” of promises.



b) Create an alternative implementation and store it in galleryB.js. In this
implementation use async functions, await and try / catch blocks.
