Exercise 4 – Your own Promises

The folder ex4 contains the file ex4.html. The HTML file contains the buttons start,
accept and reject. When the user clicks on the start button, the method
handleWithPromise is called already including call-back functions for accept and reject.
Implement the function handleWithPromise. The function should first set the status
text to “Promise pending. Please click on a button to accept or reject the promise.” As soon
as the user clicks on the accept button, the promise should be accepted. When the user
clicks on the reject button the promise should be rejected.
