Exercise 2 – JSON & HTTP Requests

This exercise only works when using a web server. Therefore, place the provided folder ex2
in the document root of your web server (see Assignment Sheet 1).

The folder contains the files gallery.html, gallery.js and gallery.json.
What is an asynchronous request? How does it differ from a synchronous request? How are
asynchronous requests supported with JS´s XMLHttpRequest?


Implement the method loadImages(domElement, jsonURI)in gallery.js that
requests the file jsonURI via an asynchronous XMLHttpRequest. 
For each image in the JSON file, a div element within domElement should be created.
Within each div there should be an image element with the image url as source.
Below the image there should be the description.



Test the implementation with the page gallery.html.
